# KRISHI-JNAN
*Krishi-Jñāna* is a smart agricultural web platform designed to empower farmers by recommending the most suitable crops based on their local conditions and predicting expected market prices at harvest time. This two-stage system blends soil science and data-driven forecasting to improve farm decisions and increase profitability.

Key Features

✅ 1. Unified LSTM Price Predictor
A single LSTM-based model predicts modal prices for all crops across all districts, trained on historical market data.

✅ 2. Contextual Crop Recommendation
Recommends the best crops based on:

District

Available soil types

Sowing month
Uses a curated database of crop–soil compatibility and maturity durations.

✅ 3. Predicts Only for Recommended Crops
For each recommended crop:

Calculates harvest month

Retrieves last 6 modal prices

Predicts harvest-time price using the trained LSTM model

✅ 4. Simple Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Users input:

🌍 District (e.g., Bengaluru Urban)

🌱 Soil type (available in that district)

📅 Sowing month (e.g., Jul)

The system responds with:

🌾 Recommended crops

💰 Predicted modal price at harvest
# How It Works
 
User Input:
District, soil type, and sowing month are collected via terminal.

Recommendation:
Filters crops suited for the soil and sowing month using a knowledge base.

Price Forecasting:
For each valid crop:

Calculates harvest month

Fetches last 6 modal prices (before harvest)

Runs prediction via LSTM model

Output:
Displays crop names with predicted modal prices at harvest.
